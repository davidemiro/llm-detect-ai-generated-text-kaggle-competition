# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text

This repository contains the code and resources for the Kaggle competition titled "LLM - Detect AI Generated Text". The primary challenge is to distinguish between text generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) and text generated by humans.
I tried two different approaches:

* Training a classification head on BERT large backbone.
* Fine-tune DistilBERT for text classification.

The best results of the two approaches (measured in AUC) are the following:

| |Private Score | Public Score |
|---|---|---|
|BERT large| 0.585034 | 0.690580 | 
|DistilBERT| 0.680852 | 0.813387  |
